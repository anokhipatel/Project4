# Project4
This project will allow a user to play a simple US Capital Quiz. All of its information and results 
of quizzes and CSV file should be in the database. When user begins their quiz, they will be provided
six questions, showing each question individually and swipe to the left for the next question.
Every time the user swipes, their result is saved and after the last swipe (after the last question),
the result of the quiz and its date is provided. The user can also access their previous results
through the main activity which displays the quiz's date and the result.
